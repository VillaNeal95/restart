## Give me Six hours to chop down a tree and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe

The above quotation was made by Abraham Lincoln, and I cannot emphasise how important adhering to that ethos was, in my opinion, in me gaining a place on the AWS Re/Start programme. The quote makes it apparent that success is all about looking beyond the immediacy and thinking towards the future. Essentially, practice makes perfect, which is why the most successful business people tend to have had a string of business failures behind them, and also why special forces soldiers are able to act on instinct and make use of muscle memory in order to achieve success. 

They have ingrained within themselves a key understaning- Successful outcomes are achieved via preparation, practice and perfection. Whilst I am not saying my answers to the questions were perfect, they did show that thought, diligence, effort and application had gone into them, and that I had not spend 5 minutes during an advertisement break whilst watching my favourite tv program to type out an ill-prepared, non-structured answer.

I had learnt from my previous experiences that it was important to be able to get to the next stage, and by this point I had experienced quite a few interviews, and had an idea about what to say and what not to say, and about how I could show enthusaism without possessing a deep technical understanding. I was aware that the course was not looking for the finished article- after all, the purpose of the Re/Start course is to teach the technical skills needed to work as a Cloud Engineer to motivated people who have the enthusiasm and dedication- but instead wanted people who wanted to be there and who would be a good fit for the program. 

### Dilligence 

I thought it was also important to be able to read the motivational questions carefully, answering in a structured manner why I would be a good fit for the course, Why I wanted to get a place on the programme and Why I would be worth the investment and would make a good employee in a partner organisation. 

In my mind, I wanted to be one of the people who progressed to the interview stage, rather than weeded out in this stage, as I was acutely aware that this was the final stage prior to the interviews, and that decisions would start to be made based on our output and atttidue to what was in front of us in this exercise. 

To that end, I really researched and tried to find out about AWS, and what exactly it offers, and on a more general basis, the purpose of these core services and how they could be used to tackle and resolve commonly faced problems to improve the efficiency and operating ability of large entities. 

My advice to applicants is to apply yourself to the maximum, and show your interest, motivation and enthusiasm... It really will show in your answers, and it will be noticed!!
