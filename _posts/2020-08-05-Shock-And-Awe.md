## Exasperation!!

Ping! The familiar sound of my Iphone was informing me that I had received an email, and that familiar sense of dread returned. Since the interview a few days previously, I had been checking my phone a lot, expecting to find a rejection email in my inbox or junk folders. Nevertheless, at this point I had completed the process and wanted to have closure to the process, and if I had received the rejection, then at least I could focus on pursuing other opportunities. 

The shock, therefore, was apparent when I read the email the first time and then had to read it again, just to check that there hadn't been a mistake, and that what it was telling me was true, that I had actually been accepted onto the AWS Re/Start programme. 

I lay in bed for a full 5 minutes, telling myself that I had finally achieved what I had set out to do, that my preparation had been rewarded and that for once, I had managed to get past the final hurdle and was about to embark on a journey which would seriously be able to change my life, should I apply myself on the course and show the same enthusiasm to potential employers. 

However, I then went downstairs, asking my Mum to see if she wanted a cup of tea. She confirmed that she did, and I then went about making that cup of tea. I told her that unfortunately, I had been unsuccessful at the final hurdle of the process yet again, and managed to keep a neutral expression and a calm, yet sullen, demeanour. 

She expressed disappointment on my behalf, saying she knew that I had put a lot of effort into the whole process and that there would be other opportunities to go for, even though that was the one I had wanted. I then asked her if she would like to read the email confirming my rejection. 

She must have missed the heading stating "AWS Re/Start offer", as it took a few moments for her to register that I had indeed been successful in gaining a place on the programme, and she then hgih fived me and confirmed that it was great news and told me off (in a jokey way) for lying! 

I had a spring in my step for the rest of the day, and I told myself that I needed to make the most of this opportunity, and started to research as much as I could about the programme, and try to find out about the potential employers/where graduates of previous cohorts had ended up. I caluclated that the course was going to start in late march, and so I wanted to make sure that I started on the front foot. However, I was not to start the course....Not yet, anyway.
