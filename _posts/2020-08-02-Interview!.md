## Interview!

A week or 2 later, I was delighted to receive the email confirming that I had been successful in reaching the next, and final, stage of the process, which consisted of a face to face interview!

I think its fair to say that at this point I was happy that my preparation and commitment to carefully crafting my answers had resulted in a successful progression to the final stage, but also that I was very apprehensive and all to aware that I would not make it past this stage, as I had not had a good success rate at final stage interviews previously. 

I had booked my interview fairly late in the day, after lunch, and I made sure to leave plenty of time for me to make my way to my local train station and then to make my way to The Prince's Trust building in Digbeth. I had another little walk around the area and then made my way to the upstairs area, and was instructed to take a seat whilst waiting for my interview. 

I was then ushered into a room and asked to fill out some details and complete a logical reasoning test before commencing the interview. The interview would discuss the completed task and ask me to elaborate on my thought process and why I had done what I had done. 

I really enjoyed my interview as I found that the interviewer was very friendly and was genuinely interested in finding out more about me, and the style of interview was much more conversational and informal as opposed to previous interviews at other companies, which had been very transactional, formal, and not dynamic or adapting to the stream of conversation, with the interviewer seemingly only interested in ticking boxes! There was even some football related banter, which made me feel more at ease!

After the interview, which I had really enjoyed and been happy that I had the chance to attend, regardless of the outcome, I made my way home on the train. I tried not to think about the interview or whether I had been successful. Looking back, it seems irrational and silly, but I did not want to jinx myself or get my hopes up, only to reach home, walk through the door, check my emails and find out that I had been unsuccessful. So I tried not to think about it too much and when I got home, I told my Mum that I had enjoyed the experience, and then politely declined to say anything more about it.  

At this point, I could look back on the whole process and genuinely say that I put a lot into the application process and crafted my answers with care, and that regardless of the outcome, I had put my best foot forward and presented myself in a good light. I had exercised influence over the parts of the process I could control, and It was now out of my control and down to others...
