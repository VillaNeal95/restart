## More Linux

For week 2, the focus remained on Linux skills. However, we begun to move away from the theory and started to apply what we had learned, and were tasked with creating a basic bash script, to help us to automate something simple. bash is a scripting language, and stands for Bourne-Again Shell,and is named after the language author, Stephen Bourne. 

It is not considered to be a coding language, but can still be very useful, and is an excellent way to get into the midnset needed to write things for yourself for the first time. Before we made our scripts towards the end of the week, we had to complete some of the practical labs, which allowed us a space to type commands. There are many Linux commands which can help you navigate your computer's file system without clicking and entering many folders. 

Some of the ones we learnt were; pwd, which stands for present working directory and allows you to see which directory you are in. For example, you might type in pwd into the command line and find that you are in the downloads directory. However, the directory you want to be in is actually the scripts directory you created to hold your projects. To get to that directory, you simply type cd scripts. This will take you to another "folder"(as they are known on windows but not Linux!!) without having to click on anything. This saves so much time, its unbelievable!! To find out what is in each directory, you can use the ls command, which means list. the list command will show you the files in each directory. So, you may have many projects in a folder, and using the list command allows you to see what and how many projects are in each folder.

Another important command we learnt about was the sudo command. Sudo means "Super user do", and if you type this before any command, it will do it without further prompting, as it will class you as the super user. This is an important command, but should not be used all the time. 

Linux is a useful skillset to have, because it can save you so much time when navigating around and makes creating directories, using the mkdir command, very easy. Deleting can also be done without having to click to the file and move it to the recycle bin by using the rmdir command. Be careful with this one though as you won't be able to undo it!!
