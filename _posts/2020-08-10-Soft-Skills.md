## The Importance of Soft Skills!

An area many people neglect or fail to see is important are interpersonal, or soft skills. These skills tend to be underrated because people believe that they are not essential to getting a job, however, is that really true?

If you were an employer, and interviewed somebody who did not make eye contact, who did not speak clearly but mumbled, who did not engage with the interviewer or said the bare minimum without showing enthusiasm, would you hire them?

Hopefully the answer would be no! Interpersonal skills make sure that you have the ability to show yourself in the best light, and that you are giving yourself the best chance of being able to secure a job by selling the skills you have learnt in the most enthusiastic and engaging way. Soft skills require an awareness of other people, and how your own actions might influence your perception from another person's point of view.

Therefore, if you were assigned some group work, you would want to make sure that you are both a contributor and allowing other people to have their opportunity to contribute. If you were in an interview, you would want to answer the interviewer's questions in a way which conveys all the required information whilst adding some things which paint you in a good light and might not necessarily be to do with technology, but which show your personality. 

Soft skills aid communication and allow someone to work effectively as part of a group but, more importantly, show other people thay they are capable of doing that. Prior to beginning AWS Re/Start, I thought that soft skills were overrated because most people had them. I think the focus on honing and developing those skills by getting out of your comfort zone really helps you, both on the course but also in life, as there will be many occasions were you will have to work with people who you may not know particularly well, for example if you are a consultant and regularly visit different client sites. 

Generation really place an emphasis on interpersonal skills, and these are focused on inbetween topics, and spaced out nicely, so that after sitting through an intense powerpoint slidedeck, you will change gears and do some discussion work with other members of the cohort! I thought this was a good way to expose us to different skills on different days, and they were spread out nicely so that we were not overloaded with a focus on soft skills at the expense of technical skills. They really help you to get to know the rest of the cohort during the first half of the course, which is nice, because by week 12 you will be comfortable asking your peers for help or just to have a general chat in the slack group should you wish.
