## Research!!

Welcome back! In my last blog post, I mentioned that The Prince's Trust advert had caught my eye, and that this seemingly random act/divine intervention had the potential to wake me from my slumber and transform my life. 

Upon reading the advert, it became apparent that I was eligible for the programme, being in the age range of 18-29 and Not in employment, education or training. At this point, I tried to find out as much as I could about the programme, whilst maintaining a sense of proportion and trying not to get ahead of myself. I was wary, because I had experienced on a few occasions making it to the final stages of the recruitment process for various jobs, but was unable to get over the line. However, apart from the excellent videos and information available on the website, and a few Linkedin profiles of previous cohort members, I wasn't able to find much, and this was a key reason that spurred me on to make this blog. You can find out more about the programme on the website, linked here; https://uk.generation.org/london/aws-restart/. However, make sure you continue to read this blog aswell!!  

Before I go any further, I think now would be a good time to talk a little bit about AWS Re/Start, and what it actually is. It is a relatively new initiative, which is a collaboration between Amazon Web Services, The Prince's Trust and Generation, who are a not for profit company founded by Mckinsey & Company. The Prince's Trust has always aimed to help young people who find themselves down on their luck, and their ability to provide mentorship, workspace and a positive environment makes them a good partner for Generation. The general aim of the programme is to expand the pool of talent entering the tech industry, and therefore people from non-technical backgrounds, those who don't have a degree or any qualifications, or those from an ethnic minority or impoverished socio-economic background are all encouraged to apply.

It's not where you've come from, but all about where you are going, and this positive ethos is encouraged and fostered throughout the course, with the focus very much on developing a "growth mindset", which means to have a can-do attitude, a belief in your ability and a never-say-die attitude, ensuring that you don't give up when challenges are thrown your way. This is a constant work in progress, as there is always room for growth, so its also about showing humility, respect and contrition, even if you think you have mastered a subject. 

In my next post, I am going to talk about the loooooooong application process, but also explain to you why its worth putting in the effort and perservering with....if anything, doing so will demonstrate a growth mindset, essential to progressing through the course and improving your technical skills!!!
