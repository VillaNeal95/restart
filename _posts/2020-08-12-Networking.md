## What does Networking mean?

If, like myself, you are from a non-technical background, you may first infer that the word "Networking" relates to how you interact with other people to achieve a desired aim. You would of course be correct!

However, Networking is also of critical importance in the world of computing. Computer Networking is similar to how people network, and thus requires devices, such as routers, to communicate with eachother so that things can be delivered from clients to hosts and vice versa. "Packets" of data need to be sent from one computer/server to another, and therefore the best route for this also needs to be selected.

This part of the course was highly technical and involved a lot of focus, notetaking and reference to other resources, such as videos, which can help to complement the understanding and teaching we had received as part of our course. I managed to find a good video, posted by Harvard university's Computer Science 50 channel, which compared the passing of messages between routers as referring someone you may know to a job. 

For example, router 1 in The United Kingdom may need to pass a message to router 5 in India. The 2 routers might not be directly connected, and so the message may need to get nearer the location of router 5 in order for another router to forward the message directly to number 5. Router number 1 may be connected to router number 3, and so think, "I can pass it to router 3, who can then pass it on for me to the end destination". This allows messages, videos, links and all manner of other accessible things on the internet to be passed between people in all parts of the world, when not directly connected via cabling. 

Essentially, the above allows the functioning of the internet as we know it, and if this type of route-tracing, referencing was not able to function, the internet as we know it today would not be accessible and large swathes of the internet would be non-accessible for people in different geographic areas. 

I highly recommend using your initiative to look for resources which can help complement your training and cement your understanding. Sometimes looking at something from a different angle or in a different way can be the difference between understanding something and being able to discuss it to being unable to talk about something for fear of getting the basics wrong. Many resources including books and videos are freely available and deliberately made easy to access and open source so that this learning can be passed on. Make sure you make use of it!
