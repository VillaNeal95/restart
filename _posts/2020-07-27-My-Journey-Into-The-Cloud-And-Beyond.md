## To New Beginnings


Welcome to my blog, and thanks for taking the time to make your way here and read what I have to say! Over the next few weeks, I would like to talk about my journey into the cloud, my aims and ambitions in life, how I ended up here, and where I hope to go. In future posts, and after week 12, I will blog about my experiences beyond the programme, and hopefully report back with a successful outcome!

My aim is to discuss my experiences on the inaugural Birmingham AWS Re/Start programme, and to raise awareness of the programme, and the potentially life-altering effect it can have on someone's trajectory in life. Ultimately, I hope you will find my experiences and story interesting, and if you find yourself at a loose end, or, like me, felt you were going nowhere in life, I would love to convince you to throw your hat in the ring, get outside of your comfort zone, and apply for this fantastic, forward-thinking inititiative. 

Now that the introductory spiel is out of the way, I can finally get around to telling you a bit about me!!!

At the turn of the year, I found myself at a crossroads. I had graduated a year and a half before, in The Summer Of 2018, from a prestigious University in the North of England, having studied a traditional subject. And yet, I found that my skills were not in demand in the workplace, and that I had failed to gain any practical skills. It didn't help that I had fallen out of love with Law since my A-Level days, and regretted not studying my passion, Military History. 

### Seminal Events


Whether it was rational or not, I began to seethe with rage at, what I believed at the time, the lies I had been told as a youth- work hard at school, pass your exams, get a degree, whizz up the corporate ladder and get on in life. My experiences in applying for jobs and not getting anywhere had led me to become stuck in a rut, a rut which i was finding it increasingly difficult to get out of, and I was becoming angrier and angrier by the day, seeing that my lived experience was completely at odds with the one I had been sold, and envisioned for myself, a decade earlier.

The days began to blur and turn into one long, indistinguishable period, and I began to lose interest in keeping track of basic things, such as what day it was. It was at this time that I was coasting through life, and had no structure to my day, and no routine to adhere to- I vividly remember staying awake playing on my Xbox, going to bed at 7am most days, after my Mother had woken up to get ready to go to work! 

I would consequently spend a large portion of the following day in bed, and it was at this point, aimlessly scrolling through my Facebook News Feed one day, that I came across an advert, which was from The Prince's Trust, and which contained the details about the AWS Re/Start programme. Whether the advert appearing on my timeline was a miracle or just entirely coincidental, I did not know. However the steps I would take after reading this advert would completely upend my life.....but not just yet!!
