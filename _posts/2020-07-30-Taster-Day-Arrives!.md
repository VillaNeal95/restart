## My First Taste Of The Cloud

About a week after completing the tests, I was invited to book a taster day, which would take place a week later. Towards the end of February, I headed to Digbeth, eager to find out more about the cloud, how to maximise my chances of getting onto the programme, but also, just to do something different and add some variety to my day. At this point, I was aware that there were 25 places on the course, and was not at all confident that I would end up gaining one of them in just a few weeks time. 

My previous interview experiences had tempered my expectations and taught me to manage one hurdle at a time, rather than getting ahead of myself. I didn't tell anybody that I was going to this taster day, as I didn't want to tell them that I had been unsuccessful yet again. So, off I went to Birmingham, glad to be doing something different for the day. I even got the chance to read The Metro newspaper, something I hadn't done in a long time! 

Upon arriving at the building and greeting the staff member who took my name and asked me to write a label with my name on, I was asked to sit down somewhere and await the start of the presentation. I was towards the back of the line and it was at this point that I was able to look around the room and take in the sheer amount of people who also were after a place on the course. I would be lying if I said I wasn't nervous! 

### aaaaaaand.....RELAX!!!

After the welcome presentation and the agenda for the day was established, we were given an icebreaker which involved moving around the room and talking to people to find those who had done something/owned something/supported a football team/had a car etc. Surprisingly, I enjoyed this task, especially after I realised that everyone else was in the same boat as me and just wanted to be able to complete the task and this put me at ease. I found myself trying to talk to people my own age, or a similar age at least, rather than just getting an answer to put on the sheet. It had been a long time since I had actually socialised with people in my own age bracket, so it was a nice change!

We then heard from an extremely intelligent AWS Solutions Architect, who told us some more about the cloud and what type of careers we could expect, and the companies we could work at, upon successful completion of the course. He told us about the whole AWS ecosystem, which had a huge demand for engineers which outstripped the supply of talent available. 

This day definitely cemented my desire to get a place on the course, and I really came home feeling like I had a sense of purpose again, something to aim for and aspire to. I made sure to tackle the next part of the application process extremely thoroughly in order to give myself the best chance of success. Until next time!
