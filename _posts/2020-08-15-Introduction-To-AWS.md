## A Plethora of Options

At the halfway point of the course, once we had covered the foundations of Linux, Networking, Security, Scripting and Python, we were introduced to AWS. AWS stands for Amazon Web Services, and rather than consisting of one thing, it is a variety of services able to be accessed through the AWS Management console (A graphical user interface), or the AWS Command Line (accessed through the terminal on your local computer and used to spin up services via typing commands and configuring settings via text). 

These services range from the simple to the complicated, and from the fully managed to completely customisable. There are 3 main types of structure which different applications can be

1.Infrastructure As A Service (IAAS)- IAAS provides the building blocks, or basic infrastructure, such as access to servers, data storage and networking features. The onus is then on the service user to customise the infrastructure according to their own need. Essentially, IAAS provides the maximum degree of flexibility, with the underlying infrastructure provided, waiting to be configured.

2.Platform As A Service (PAAS)- PAAS also focuses on the underlying infrastructure, and so includes the above, but also has a degree of flexbility included, making it easier to manage the hosted software. with PAAS applications, you can manage the complete web application lifecycle, building, testing, deploying, managing and updating. 

3.Software As A Service (SAAS)- SAAS is where the cloud really displays its power, and allows applications to be accessed using only the internet and a device. Users do not have to install anything, as the service will be availble in the form of software on their mobile or personal computing device. The software is typically licenced on a subscription based model. Netflix is probably the best known SAAS example, as it is on-demand software and centrally hosted by AWS. 

Many user-based applications now opt for the SAAS model because of how easy it is for the user to navigate. Having the application centrally managed also allows for Auto-Scaling groups to be used, for example if a new series is released, then a streaming service can ensure that the application remains accessible throughout the peak period by increasing the number of servers available to ensure that all of the users can be serviced with high quality visuals/no buffering issues. Once the peak period has passed, the servers can be scaled back in, ensuring that spare capacity is not being paid for and the number of servers is equivalent to the number of users. This flexibility and pay as you go pricing model is the cornerstone of cloud computing, and good for many users, ranging from individual users to large and small companies.
