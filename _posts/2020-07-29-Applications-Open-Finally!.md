## End of January



After what seemed like an eternity, applications were finally open! I actually received an email to confirm this, but I had been checking everyday by manually navigating to the site, in the hope that the button saying "Register Your Interest" had changed to "Apply Now!"....so when it finally said that after over a month of this, it was a great relief! sad I know...but a relief nonetheless! 

At this point, I had read the web page so many times, so I knew that I would have to submit my details and then complete some tests, which didn't require any prior knowledge of the cloud computing or technology industry. I found this part of the process informative, as the resources I was exposed to told me a bit more about the world of cloud computing, in a way which was easy to understand and not intimidating to a newbie to the tech world. The application process was inclusive at all times and ensured a level playing field. 

There was also the opportunity to demonstrate your motivation for applying to the programme, and it was at this part of the process that I was able to say why I wanted to get into tech and what I could bring to the programme. There was then a wait of about a week, and I was delighted to find out that I had been invited to a taster day, which was to be held at The Prince's Trust Digbeth office, helpfully located a quick stroll away from Birmingham New Street Station. The office is in a really good central location, and just around the corner from Birmingham's tech hub and The Custard Factory! I was able to have a quick walk around the area and check out some of the cool artwork and, if i'm lucky, potential future places of work! 

In the next post, I'll talk about how informative the taster day was, and how I came away from that with a burning desire to reach the interview stage and be able to put myself in a position in which I would be able to get across my passion for starting a career in tech.
