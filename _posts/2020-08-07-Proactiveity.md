## Being Proactive!

writing this after being on the course, its clear that this really is key! After the initial setback that the course had been pushed back by 3 months, I was determined to try and find out as much as I could about it, and also to try and learn about the things which I believed would give me a good headstart and a solid foundation on which to build.

In addition to trying to further research the course online, I attempted to learn about Python, using some of the many freely available resources online. I would recommend trying to find resources which suit your style of learning, as some people prefer to code along whilst watching videos on youtube whilst other people prefer to make their way through a book at their own pace. 

I found that making use of a combination of these, aswell as reading blog posts was able to give me a solid idea of some of the concepts. I chose not to study too much prior to the course, but I was able to grasp how popular python as a coding language is and why it is used so much in large and small companies across the world. Essentially, what would take pages and pages of code to do in some languages can be done in a few lines with python, which makes it good for the beginner to pick up. This also applies to Javascript, which is also a good language to learn and can be used in many scenarios. The languages are both less mechanical, and more in the prose style which we are used to, and so you can generally pick up the context of something, and see what it is trying to accomplish, before diving in further.

Personally, I wanted to see what things we would be taught about on the course before using it too much, but I was able to make use of For and While loops in the terminal, and able to see which scenarios they are useful for. As I am writing this with the benefit of hindsight, I intend to further my skills in python and make use of loops in order to build projects to post on to github, which have the benefit of maintaining and growing my coding skills whilst creating a portfolio which employers can view.

I also used this time to find out more about the certification we would be attempting to gain as part of the course, The AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner Exam. There are lots of videos discussing the topics of the exam online, as well as index cards and quizzes to complement the knowledge you build on the course. These are resources I will be revisiting with the benefit of 12 weeks of knowledge on the various core cloud services, and I will be making use of study guides, amazon whitepapers and documents and discussion forums in order to give myself the best chance of passing. 

Once I have completed the Certified Cloud Practitioner Exam (And hopefully gained some form of cloud related employment!!) I intend to study and sit the AWS Solutions Architect Associate exam. This certification is a good one to study for after completion of the AWS Re/Start course because it builds upon the foundation exam and requires a more in depth knowledge of the core AWS services studied over the 12 week course and in the foundation course.
