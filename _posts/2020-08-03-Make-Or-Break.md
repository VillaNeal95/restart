## Now or Never!!

After attending the taster day, I made my way back to New Street Station, and realised I had just over an hour until my train back home. I decided to have a walk around The Bullring shopping center, and made my way into the HMV store, not seeking out anything in particular. 

Upon entering the store, I was surprised to see that they were selling a range of books on the music industry, and duly purchased a book about The artist, Prince (or the artist formerly known as prince, if you know your musical history ;)), and another couple of books, which were part of a deal, about the history of Grime music and a history on the band Oasis. 

I then decided to walk around the city center, and made my way to The Works bookshop and a few other stores, this time just browsing. This walk gave me time to take stock of the day and recount what had happened. Although I had really enjoyed the day, and finding out about the role of a cloud engineer, I would be lying if I said that I thought I would make it on to the programme. I was aware that there were just over 20 places, and when I had walked into the Prince's Trust Building, I had realised that there must have been over 100 potential students present. 

Previously, I had made it to the final stages of interviews and always fallen short, and so I was naturally pessimistic as to my chances of gaining a place on the course. However, one thing that ahd been stressed prior to the open day, and again in a presentation at the start of the day, was how to be successful in our application. I made sure to go over in my head what exactly I needed to do next to give myself the best chance, and made sure that I had a plan to do enough to at least get to the interview stage, which would give me the chance to sell myself and elaborate in more detail what exactly I could bring to the course and why I should be one of the lucky few to be picked for a place. 

The next stage of the application process would involve a answering some motivational questions and coming up with an innovative solution to a theoretical problem. This stage did not require any in depth knowledge of the Cloud and the technology used, however, I really made sure to invest a lot of time in this part of the process, because I knew that doing so would allow me to get to the interview stage and give myself a fighting chance of being successful. This meant I really took the time to think about what I was writing and also I decided to go above and beyond in my efforts, ensuring I found out as much as I could about the sheer scale of Amazon Web Services and some of the services available to help people/entities/clients solve problems.
